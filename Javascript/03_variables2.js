// 3 ways to create variables in Js

// let => if we have to change a variable, then use let 
// const => use const by 
// var

let variable1 = 3;      
console.log(variable1);

let calculation = 2+2;
console.log(calculation);

let result = calculation + 5;
console.log(result);

variable1 = 5;     // Re-assigning the value to a variable
console.log(variable1);


// Const

// Const => Can't change its value later. Value stays constant.

const variable2 = 8;

// In order to keep the code safer -> Best practice = use const by default.
// (Only use let when we need to change the variable)

const messgae = `hello`;
console.log(messgae)


// Var

// var => var creates a variable just like let & This variable can change later.
// var is actually the orginal way to create the variable in javascript.

// var => Means variable

// var have some issues bcoz of that issues we don't use var in new javascript code.
